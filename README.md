Biscuits Project.
This is a class project: we have to create a site to sell a product by our choice.
First of all we had to create an our template on Figma or similar programs and choose a palette color.
Then we could create the website in HTML and CSS (No JS allowed).

As the title of the repository says, this is a site that sells Biscuits
